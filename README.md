### [Syrtis] (./Syrtis)

It was intended to create a multiplayer board game in this programming language building a text interface. A game that was characterized by tiles and pieces types,
movimentation rules and termination conditions.

### [Pinwheel] (./Pinwheel)

The main goal was to create a program with restrictions, solving an optimization problem. We created a random generator of a Pinwheel puzzle, solving it after the generation.

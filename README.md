### Description

The main goal of this subject was to understand the main concepts of [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog), a programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics.

### [Syrtis] (./Syrtis)

It was intended to create a multiplayer board game and build a text interface in this programming language. A game that was characterized by tiles and pieces types,
movimentation rules and termination conditions.

### [Pinwheel] (./Pinwheel)

The main goal was to create a program with restrictions by solving an optimization problem. We created a random generator of a Pinwheel puzzle, solving it after the generation.
